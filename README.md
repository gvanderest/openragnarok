# Open Ragnarok

This repository is intended to be a collection of tools and libraries for the Ragnarok Online game.  The goal is to provide documentation for the assorted filetypes and formats used by the game, with the eventual goal of a complete implementation of parsers (and maybe editors) to manipulate it.

The longer term goal is to eventually make some form of server and client clone of the game to help me with learning to develop games, learn some more Rust, and generally define my hobby.

NOTE: I provide absolutely zero warranty or support for any of the tools or libraries in this repository.

## Sources of Note

I will try to provide sources in assorted README files closer to the place they are used, but some sources have already stood out as being useful from the start:

- Ragnarok Research Lab - https://github.com/RagnarokResearchLab/ - Some examples of Arcturus+Ragnarok file formats and parsers, primarily in Lua, to use as examples-- as well as a RagLite server example.
